# Lullaby Mobile

Mobile app for [Lullaby](https://github.com/aurasphere/lullaby), an open source smart music box.

The app allows to compose melodies (listening to the device music in real-time), saving them in files, exporting/importing to/from the Bluetooth connected device and start the music box remotely.

By default, melodies are stored in ```/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/co.aurasphere.lullaby/files```. You can try any of the melodies in the sample folder by just copying it there.
